/*

Factor Tree is an intuitive method to understand the factors of a number. It shows how all the factors are been derived from the number. It is a special diagram where you find the factors of a number, then the factors of those numbers, etc until you canâ€™t factor anymore. The ends are all the prime factors of the original number.
Example: 
 

Input : v = 48
Output : Root of below tree
   48
   /\
  2  24
     /\
    2  12
       /\
      2  6
         /\
        2  3
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The factor tree is created recursively. A binary tree is used. 
 

We start with a number and find the minimum divisor possible.
Then, we divide the parent number by the minimum divisor.
We store both the divisor and quotient as two children of the parent number.
Both the children are sent into function recursively.
If a divisor less than half the number is not found, two children are stored as NULL.
